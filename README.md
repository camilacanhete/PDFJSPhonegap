# PDF.js For Phonegap

This is a custom build made for Phonegap developers since both iPhone and Android runs Webkit.
Webkit lacks many features requested from official Mozilla PDF.js version.

It was tested on *iPhone 6.1*, *Android SDK 10 (version 2.3)* and above. It might work with *IE8* aswell, but it wasn't verified.

The PDF.js version i got was 1.0.1040 - a pretty stable and fast version that might be good in most cases. 

Since i spent 2 days trying to make it possible, there is no need for you to do the same. Enjoy!

If you have any problem or question, the original team can answer better than me.
